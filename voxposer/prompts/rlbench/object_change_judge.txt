I need you to help me determine whether the position of OBJECT_TEMPLATE in the two images is consistent. If it is consistent, you need to output True, otherwise you need to output Falseã€‚
Details:
1. The images you see may be from cameras with different viewing angles. When judging whether the positions of OBJECT_TEMPLATE in two images are consistent, the viewing angle factor needs to be considered. If only the viewing angle is different, their positions are considered consistent.
2. You should answer the question with the format shown below.

Format:

***User part***
Question: Do you think the position of OBJECT_TEMPLATE is consistent in the two pictures I showed you?

***Agent part***
Answer: True or False
Reason: The reason of why you choose the answer True or False.

Note:
1. You only need to return the result of Agent part shown above.
