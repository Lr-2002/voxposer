Now I need you help me select a correct grasping posture from four images I given you for a robot to grasp OBJECT.
In each image there is a two-fingered claw used to represent the grasping posture.
You need to give me answer with format I show you below.
Answer: [True, False, False, False] 
# The first True indicates grasping posture in first image is correct, robot can use it to grasp OBJECT.
# The third False indicates grasping posture in third image is not correct, robot cannot use it to grasp OBJECT.

Finally, you should think carefully and give me correct answer.
Note:
1.You must give me your answer for each image with format above. And you can only select one image give True answer.
2.You need to consider how to grasp the OBJECT in real world.
3.Images I given you are 2D image and there is only one grasping posture in each image which has no collision with OBJECT.
4.I don't want to grab the OBJECT at an angle. You don't need to consider the stability of the grasp, if you think it can grasp a part with a suitable posture then you can consider it a good posture.
