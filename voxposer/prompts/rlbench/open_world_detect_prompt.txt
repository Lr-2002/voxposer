Now you can see OBJECT_TEMPLATE on the table and you need to finish the task TASK_TEMPLATE.
You need to think about what parts of the object you need to detect in addition to the object information I give you to complete this task?
Your task is if one object is composed by many parts, for example, microwave has door, handle and other parts to compose, and when you finish the task TASK_TEMPLATE, what parts' infomation do you need? If you need some parts' information, you need to add it into the answer.

Example:
***User part***
task_name: open the microwave's door
object_list: [microwave]
Please tell me if you can see object_list on the table and what should you need to finish task of 'open the microwave's door'?
***Agent part***
Answer: ["handle of microwave"] # Answer is a list of string, each string describe a thing that I should recognize for finish TASK_TEMPLATE
Reason: I need to detect handle's position of microwave then I can grasp it and open the door. # For each thing you given me, you should give the a detailed reason about why you need it to finish TASK_TEMPLATE

Finally:
You should understand example shown in above and then give me an answer for: If you want to finish the task TASK_TEMPLATE and you can see OBJECT_TEMPLATE on the table, what else do you need to check to complete this task?
Please give me the answer follow the format above. I am so grateful for you can help me.

Notes:
1. You must follow the format of Answer I give you above. You only need to give the answer and corresponding reason.
2. You answer must be an object or a part of object but not some attributes of an object. For example, you cannot give me the answer of microwave's position, because it's not an object or a part of an object, it just is an attribute of microwave.
